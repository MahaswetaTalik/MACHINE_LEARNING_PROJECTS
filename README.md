Welcome to my Machine Learning Projects Repository, where I develop and deploy predictive models for real-world applications. This repository features data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, and predictive modeling for tasks like sales forecasting and fraud detection, leveraging Python, SQL, and Power BI. It includes implementations of classification, regression, and anomaly detection techniques, optimized for efficiency and accuracy. I explore deployment frameworks such as Streamlit and Gradio to make machine learning models accessible, while integrating Power BI dashboards and R custom visualizations for enhanced analytics. Feel free to explore, contribute, and share insights!
